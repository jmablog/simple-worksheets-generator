A series of templates for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to convert a single Markdown input into beautiful and simple Word, HTML, and PDF outputs. As using these templates breaks some useful Quarto built-in functionality, also included is a [Pandoc lua filter](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html) to make use of some formatting shortcodes, and add some other useful features.

## Features

**Pop-out boxes:** Use Pandoc's fenced divs feature to create coloured breakout boxes:

```
::: Aside

Contents here.

:::

```

The current options are `Aside` (yellow), `Questions` (grey), `Tip` (blue), `Success` (green), and `Warning` (red). Check the example outputs to see them in action.

**LaTeX shortcuts:** Use `\wordtoc` to insert a Word table of contents, as this won't be automatically generated when use `toc` options in Pandoc, and `\newpage` for a manual page break.

**Auto-link questions and answers:** Use Pandoc's bracketed spans feature to create linked questions and answers using Q<number> and A<number>:

```

[Q1]{}. The number of this question will be auto-linked to A1 wherever it appears on the page.

...

[A1]{}. This answer is auto-linked to Q1 above.

```

**References:** Store your bibliography using biblatex in `_bib/references.bib`. Create citations in text with [Pandoc's citation format](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax), e.g. `[@Adams2020]`. A full reference list will be automatically placed at the end of the output document, or can be placed anywhere using a [fenced div](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-fenced_divs) with the id `#refs`.

```

:::{#refs}
:::

```

## Usage

- Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html). Some additional dependencies may be required, for example, a [TeX installation](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html#tex) if you don't have one already, or Python/R if you intend to use them in your materials - see the Quarto installation page for full details. You might also want to grab [Open Sans](https://www.opensans.com/) for the PDF font, or else change it to one you already have in `_quarto.yml`.
- Clone or download this repo to your local machine.
- Write your materials as required - either as plain Markdown files (`.md`) or using Quarto's own file type (`.qmd`). These can be in the base project directory, or stored in sub-folders to more conveniently keep related material together (e.g. image files to be included), in which case the directory structure used will be echoed in the output directory.
- From a terminal at the base project directory, simply run `quarto render`. Your output files should appear in the `_WORKSHEETS` folder.

## Customisation

The `_quarto.yml` file contains most of the configuration options for these worksheet - in particular, a lot of the PDF output formatting such as fonts (by default I used [Open Sans](https://www.opensans.com/)) or page margins. These are all either [Quarto project options](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/core.html) or [Pandoc options](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#options) - add or change these as desired.

For further customisation, you can simply make changes to the templates themselves in `_resources/templates`. They are named for each output format. If you know CSS / LaTeX / Word styles, go nuts!

## Credit

The html template used is gently adapted from the [GitHub Pandoc HTML5 template](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tajmone/pandoc-goodies/blob/master/templates/html5/github/GitHub-Template-Preview.html) from the [pandoc-goodies](https://github.com/tajmone/pandoc-goodies) repository by Tristano Ajmone.

Pandoc lua filters are inspired and adapted from examples given in the Pandoc [lua filters GitHub repo](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters).

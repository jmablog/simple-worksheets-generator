# References

References will be automatically placed at the end of a document (I suggest including a heading for them still), or you can control their placement anywhere in the document using a fenced div with the id `#refs`:

````
:::{#refs}
:::
````

## Example references

::: {#refs}

\newpage

# Answers to questions

Marked with a `Questions` fenced div to match colouring, but the question/answer linking should work outside a fenced div too.

::: Questions

[A2]{}. Second answer here.
